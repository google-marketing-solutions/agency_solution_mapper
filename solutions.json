It allows clients to use their own (1P) transactional data to identify the most valuable clients for a customer centric marketing strategy. Since customers don't have to share their 1P data, it's privacy-friendly and relatively easy and quick to implement. The pipeline can be set up and running in around 15 minutes.\n\nMain use cases: \n- Focus on simplicity / efficiency; FoCVS is a cheap, quick & easy-to-use way to start implementing a CLV-optimized marketing strategy.\n- Focus on privacy; input data does not need to be shared with Google or any other company.\n- Focus on flexibility; users can run the pipeline as many times as they want, using different input data or different parameters, on Google Cloud or on-prem\n\nLimitations: \n- Probabilistic models look at a specific snapshot in time and do not incorporate a \"learning effect\" as with ML solutions.\n- CLV of new customers (purchase propensity) can\u2019t be predicted at all, CLV of one-time buyers can be predicted (but rather poorly in comparison to ML solutions).\n- FoCVS does not use custom 1P data features for CLV predictions, rather only for segmentation (i.e. creating audience lists). If the data activation strategy aims to use direct conversion manipulation (e.g. through the Offline Conversion Import or Conversion Adjustments functionality), then ML solutions are more suited.\n",

Users of [BQFlow](https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/bqflow) can quickly move data into tables, write custom SQL, connect dashboards, and even write back to an API using BQFlow.  Because it's [open source](https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/bqflow), the workflow can then be given to the client using a single JSON file.\n\nBQFlow allows anyone to move data to and from Google APIs and BigQuery without coding.  A [JSON workflow](https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/bqflow/wiki#example-workflows) file is used to list the [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer) and [BigQuery endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables-intro) which can then be executed in a [Colab Notebook](https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/bqflow/blob/main/colab.ipynb), VM, or Command Line.  BQFlow leverages [Google's built-in Discovery API](https://developers.google.com/discovery) enabling it to support hundreds of Google APIs with only one simple connector, including [Google Ads](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/rest/overview).  \n\n[BQFlow JSON workflows ](https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/bqflow/wiki#example-workflows) use Google's already published [RESTFUL API documents](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer).  \n",

Clients usually identify trends with Google Analytics (GA4) data on their site. In this case, the input is literally a list of terms and [optionally] their descriptions or extra info about them.\n\n - External trends: if the client has a fixed list of products, brands or services they want to advertise (might be, for example, a category of products in particular), Topic Mine will take that list and try to find a relationship between each item and trending topics obtained from an external source. If there is a relationship between what the client offers and some trending topic, it will create ads' content for that.\n\nThe output of this project is a spreadsheet with the generated headlines, descriptions and keywords ready to be imported to SA360, DV360 or ACS.",
